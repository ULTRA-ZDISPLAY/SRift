It's a mini social network for profile and image publication in php, and with sqlite for the database,
you can modify the code and do what you want with it, as long as you credit us in very small print at the bottom of the page with a contrast with the background.
It uses the steam 2003 design and doesn't use bootstrap (css framework) because we don't like that.

There are two default accounts (thezelflor and zelflor) and their password is 1234.
